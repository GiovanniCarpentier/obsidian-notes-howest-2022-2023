# Network Devices
## Switch
A network switch connects devices within a network (often a [local area network, or LAN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-lan/)*) and forwards [data packets](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-packet/) to and from those devices. Unlike a [router](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-router/), a switch only sends data to the single device it is intended for (which may be another switch, a router, or a user's computer), not to networks of multiple devices.

## Router
[Routers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en_uk/solutions/small-business/networking/routers.html) guide and direct network data, using packets that contain various kinds of data—such as files, communications, and simple transmissions like web interactions.

## Gateway
A computer that sits between different networks or applications. The gateway converts information, data or other communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may perform some of the functions of a gateway. An Internet gateway can transfer communications between an enterprise network and the Internet.

## Acces Point
An [access point](https://www.linksys.com/for-business/products/wireless-access-points/) is a device that creates a wireless local area network, or WLAN, usually in an office or large building. An access point connects to a wired router, switch, or hub via an Ethernet cable, and projects a WiFi signal to a designated area.

## Hub
A network hub is a node that broadcasts data to every computer or Ethernet-based device connected to it. A hub is less sophisticated than a [switch](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/switch), the latter of which can isolate data transmissions to specific devices. Network hubs are best suited for small, simple local area network ([LAN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/local-area-network-LAN)) environments.
