## Evil Twin Hotspot
- They are set up by attackers who want to steal sensitive information such as login credentials or financial information from users.
- They can be set up anywhere, but are often found in public places like airports, hotels, and coffee shops where people are likely to be using public Wi-Fi.
- They are designed to look like legitimate hotspots, so users may not realize they are connecting to an illegitimate network.
- Once connected to an evil twin hotspot, users may be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, phishing attacks, and malware infections.

## Ransomware
- Ransomware attacks usually involve the attacker encrypting the victim's data and demanding a payment (the ransom) in exchange for the decryption key.
- Ransomware can be spread through various means, including email attachments, infected websites, and malicious ads.
- Ransomware can be very costly for individuals and organizations, as it can result in lost time, money, and sensitive data.
- Ransomware can be difficult to defend against, as it can evolve quickly and take advantage of new vulnerabilities.

## Nations
- Nation-state cyber attacks are typically carried out for strategic or political purposes, such as espionage, sabotage, or information warfare.
- Nation-state cyber attacks are often highly sophisticated and well-funded, and can involve the use of zero-day vulnerabilities, custom malware, and other advanced techniques.
- Nation-state cyber attacks can be very difficult to defend against, as they may not be detected until significant damage has been done.
- Nation-state cyber attacks can have serious consequences for individuals, organizations, and countries, including financial losses, reputational damage, and loss of critical infrastructure.

## Threat Actors
- Threat actors can be motivated by a variety of factors, including financial gain, political or ideological objectives, or personal revenge.
- Threat actors can range from lone hackers to organized criminal groups to nation-states.
- Threat actors use a variety of tactics and techniques to carry out their attacks, including phishing, malware, ransomware, and denial of service (DoS) attacks.
- Threat actors often target specific organizations or individuals, and may tailor their attacks to exploit specific vulnerabilities or to steal specific types of data.

## Threat Impact
- The impact of a threat can vary widely, depending on the nature of the attack and the target.
- Threats can have a number of negative impacts, including financial losses, reputational damage, loss of critical infrastructure, and harm to individuals.
- The impact of a threat can be difficult to predict or quantify, as it can depend on a variety of factors such as the success of the attack, the resilience of the target, and the effectiveness of any mitigating actions.
- To minimize the impact of a threat, it is important for individuals and organizations to implement strong cybersecurity measures and to have a plan in place for responding to and recovering from an attack.
- Some data a threat can habe impact to are
	- **PII (Personal Identifiable Information)**
	- **PHI (Protected Health Information)**
	- **PSI (Personal Security Information)**

## The Modern SOC
- A modern SOC typically includes a team of cybersecurity professionals with expertise in areas such as network security, threat intelligence, incident response, and forensics.
- The team may work on a variety of tasks, including monitoring networks and systems for security events, analyzing security logs and alerts, conducting investigations, and coordinating responses to incidents.
- A modern SOC may use a range of tools and technologies to support its work, including security information and event management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS), and threat intelligence platforms.
- A modern SOC may also work closely with other teams within an organization, such as IT, legal, and communications, to ensure a coordinated and effective response to security incidents.
- People that work in the SOC are
	- **Tier 1 (Alert Analyst)**
	- **Tier 2 (Incident Responder)**
	- **Tier 3 (Threat Hunter)**
