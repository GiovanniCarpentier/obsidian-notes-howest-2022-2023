# Encryption
## Encryption and Cryptography are not the same
#Encryption-vs-Cryptography

- Encryption is just a technique to make sure data are only readable with a given key
	- Data confidentiality
- Data integrity, authentication require other cryptography techniques

## Symmetric Key Encryption
#Symmetric-Key-Encryption
#xor-logical-operator 

- Symmetric implies that the same key is used (and needs to be available) on both sides. 
- The 2 users share an identical symmetric encryption key

### Stream Cipher
#Stream-Cipher
- Symmetric Encryption implies that encryption and decryption require the same key to be used on both sides
- Plaintext XOR gives the cipher text
- Ciphertext XOR gives the original plaintext back

- A stream cipher is one that encrypts a digital data stream one bit or one byte at a time
	- Works with an endless stream and is not block-oriented
- A one-time pad means that the cryptographic keystream is random
	- [One-time pad video]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlIG3TvQCBQ
	- This cipher is unbreakable by any other means other than acquiring the keystream
- the bit-stream generator is a key-controlled (or seed-controlled) algorithm
- This stream is not random but pseudo-random

### Block Cipher
#Block-Cipher
- A block cipher treats a block of plaintext as a whole and is used to produce a ciphertext block of equal lenght
- 64 or 128 bits block size is typically used
- The vast majority of network-based symmetric cryptographic applications make use of block ciphers
	- DES (64 bit blocks, 56 bit key)
	- AES (128 bit blocks, 128 bit key or 192 bit key or 256 bit key)
- The encryption and decryption algorithms are equal (DES, general Feistel ciphers) or very similar (AES)
- We need to make sure the predictability in the plaintext cannot be found and exploited in the ciphertext when we split a big plaintext file into equal blocks and we just encrypt these blocks using a good algorithm such as AES then the encrypted blocks are predictable. This is called the ECB mode of operation. Therefore we need more sophisticated modes of operation

## CBC or CTR modes of operation
#xor-logical-operator 
#modes-of-operation
#cbc
#ctr
#gcm

### CBC
- We xor the plaintext of the second block with the cipher of the previous block

### CTR
- We encrypt fixed counters and then we XOR the plaintext with these encrypted counters so in the decryption phase the CTR mode of operation only uses the encryption algorithm

## GCM
- Galois Counter Mode, Extension of CTR used for authentication encryption

## Asymmetric Key Encryption or Public Key Cryptography
#Asymetric-Key-Encryption
#Public-Key-Cryptography

- Asymmetric implies that different keys needs to be available on both sides. Pairs of keys are matched via mathematics

- The steps are the following
1. Each user generates a pair of keys to be used for encryption and decryption
2. Each user places one of the 2 keys in a public register or other accessible file
	1. This is the public key. 
	2. The companion key is the private key.
3. If user 1 wants to send a confidential message to user 2
	1. User 1 encypts the message using the public key of user 2
	2. User 2 decrypts the message using their own private key

- Public key Cryptography is mainly a solution for 2 problems: Key Distribution and Digital Signatures
- Example is RSA that used to have a bit length of 1024 but is now often 2048 or 4096 bits
- Part A is used for Confidentiality (Encryption)
- Part B is used for Authentication (Digital Signature)

- Symmetric encryption is far more peformant (1000 times) than Asymmetric encryption

- RSA (2048) and RSA (4096) are popular bit lengths for asymmetric algorithms
- ECC (Elliptical Curve Cryptography [[Elliptical Curve Arithmetic]]) has a key length of 256 bits or 512 bits

## [[Diffie Hellman Key Exchange]]
#Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange

- Diffie Hellman allows two parties who have not met before and who have not agreed on some set of keys or some shared secret (or. PKI), to start a secure communication. Essentially, the protocol allows to exchange some values so that both parties shall obtain the same shared secret. A man in he middle who obtains all information exchanged is not able to create the shared secret.
- The shared secret cannot immediately be used as a key for symmetric encryption between both parties because it is not sufficiently random, but it can be input to a key derivation function to produce a usable key.
- Diffie-Hellman is based on the same theory as asymmetric crypto. Actually, the protocol boils down to each party generating a random, treating this as a temporary private key, calculating a public key based on this private key, and sending the public key to the other party. Both parties then have the otherâ€™s public key and their own private key, and can use this to calculate a shared secret. There is an RSA and an ECC version of Diffie-Hellman.
- Encrypted messaging between parties, e.g. WhatsApp or Signal, starts off with a variant of Diffie Hellman to agree on a shared secret that is then used as a basis of symmetric encryption. A major difference is that the Diffie Hellman-like protocol needs to be able to run in a non interactive way (when one party is offline). The public keys based on the randoms that are generated on the fly by each party, are pre-published.
