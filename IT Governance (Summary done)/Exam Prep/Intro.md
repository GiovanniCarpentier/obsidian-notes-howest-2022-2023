#Governance

## Why do we need governance?
- an organization or community is run in a transparent, accountable, and effective manner.
- decisions are made in the best interests of the organization or community as a whole, rather than being influenced by the interests of a small group of individuals.
- resources are allocated and used efficiently and effectively.
- prevent or mitigate conflicts of interest and corruption.
- build trust and confidence among stakeholders, including members, customers, shareholders, and the general public.
- an organization or community is able to adapt and respond to changing circumstances and challenges.

## What can go wrong in a project?
- **Scope creep**: This occurs when the scope of the project starts to expand beyond what was originally agreed upon, which can lead to delays and cost overruns.
- **Poor communication**: Lack of effective communication among team members can lead to misunderstandings, lack of transparency, and a breakdown in trust.
- **Inadequate resources**: If a project does not have sufficient resources, such as funding, manpower, or materials, it can be difficult to complete the project on time and within budget.
- **Poor planning**: If a project is not properly planned, it can be difficult to execute and may result in unforeseen problems or setbacks.
- **Changes in the market**: If the market changes unexpectedly, it can impact the feasibility of a project and require adjustments to be made.
- **Technical issues**: Projects that involve complex technology can be prone to technical issues, which can cause delays and additional costs.

## How does it relate to security?
- IT Governance is closely related to security because it helps to ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect the organization's data and systems.
- Some key components of IT Governance that relate to security include:
    - **Risk assessment and management**: Identifying and evaluating potential risks to the organization's IT assets and implementing controls to mitigate those risks.
    - **Access controls**: Ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and systems.
    - **Security awareness training**: Educating employees about the importance of security and how to protect themselves and the organization from cyber threats.
    - **Incident response plan**: Having a plan in place to respond to security breaches or other incidents that may compromise the organization's data or systems.

## How does it relate to data?
- IT Governance includes policies, procedures, and practices for the proper handling, storage, and protection of data.
- It also involves establishing roles and responsibilities for those who have access to data, as well as establishing protocols for data access and handling.
- IT Governance helps organizations ensure compliance with data protection laws and regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
- It also helps organizations protect their data from security breaches, unauthorized access, and other potential threats.
- Effective IT Governance helps organizations make informed decisions about the use of their data, ensuring that it is used in a way that is aligned with the organization's goals and values.

## How does it relate to software development?
- In the context of software development, IT Governance can help ensure that software projects are aligned with the organization's overall strategy and goals, and that they are being developed in a controlled and efficient manner.
- IT Governance can help ensure that software development projects are being managed effectively, with clear roles and responsibilities, and that they are being monitored and controlled to ensure that they are delivered on time and on budget.
- IT Governance can also help ensure that software development projects are being developed in a secure and compliant manner, and that they meet the necessary standards and regulations.
