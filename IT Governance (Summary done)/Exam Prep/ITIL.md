    - **Service transition**: The process of implementing and transitioning to new or modified IT services
    - **Service operation**: The process of operating and maintaining IT services
    - **Continual service improvement**: The process of continuously evaluating and improving IT services to optimize value and meet changing business needs.
- ITIL is designed to help organizations deliver high-quality IT services that meet the needs of their customers and stakeholders.
