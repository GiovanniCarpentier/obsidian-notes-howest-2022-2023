## What is the importance of a business case?
- A business case is a document that outlines the justification for a proposed business or project.
- It is used to explain the benefits, costs, and risks associated with a proposed project, and to persuade stakeholders to approve the project.
- A business case helps decision-makers understand the potential consequences of a project and whether it is worth pursuing.
- It can also be used to set expectations with stakeholders and to track progress once the project is underway.
- A well-written business case can help ensure that a project is aligned with an organization's goals and objectives, and that it has the support it needs to succeed.

## How do we develop a business case?
- Identify the problem or opportunity that the business case will address
- Gather data and research on the potential costs and benefits of addressing the problem or opportunity
- Develop a clear and concise overview of the proposed solution
- Identify the key stakeholders and their potential impact on the decision to pursue the solution
- Outline the risks and uncertainties associated with the solution
- Identify any alternative solutions and their potential costs and benefits
- Compare the pros and cons of each potential solution to determine the best course of action
- Create a budget and timeline for implementation of the chosen solution
- Present the business case to decision makers and key stakeholders for approval and implementation.

## What are the key aspects of a business case?
- Identifying the problem or opportunity being addressed
- Analyzing the current situation and potential impact on the organization
- Outlining the potential solutions to the problem or opportunity

- Regularly review and update the plan to address changing business needs and potential threats

## What are sunk costs and why are these important?
- Sunk costs are costs that have already been incurred and cannot be recovered.
- These costs are important because they are not relevant to decision making in the present or future.
- Ignoring sunk costs can help prevent emotional attachment to a project or decision, and can allow for more rational decision making.
- Sunk costs should not be considered when determining whether to continue investing in a project or not.
- It is important to recognize sunk costs in order to avoid the sunk cost fallacy, where individuals continue investing in a project or decision due to the sunk costs already incurred, rather than based on the potential future benefits.

## Do we need to update the business case?
- If there have been any significant changes to the project scope, objectives, or budget
- If there have been any shifts in market conditions or industry trends that could impact the project
- If new information or data has come to light that could alter the project's expected outcomes or benefits
- If the project team has identified any additional risks or challenges that could impact the business case
- If the project's expected return on investment or payback period has changed significantly
- If any key stakeholders have changed their support for or commitment to the project
- If the project has missed any key milestones or deadlines that could impact its success

## What is the make or buy decision?
- The make or buy decision is a decision-making process that involves weighing the costs and benefits of producing a product or service in-house versus outsourcing it to an external supplier.
- This decision takes into account factors such as the cost of production, the availability of raw materials and labor, the efficiency and productivity of in-house processes, and the impact on the organization's overall goals and objectives.
- The make or buy decision is often driven by cost considerations, as outsourcing may be more cost-effective in certain situations. However, other factors such as quality, reliability, and lead time may also be important considerations.
- In some cases, the make or buy decision may be influenced by external factors such as market demand or regulatory requirements.
- The make or buy decision is a dynamic process that may change over time as the organization's needs and circumstances evolve.

## Can you explain (high level) the time value of money?
- The time value of money refers to the idea that money is worth more in the present than in the future.
- This is because money can be invested and earn a return, leading to an increase in the amount of money over time.
- The time value of money is an important concept in finance, as it is used to determine the present value of future cash flows.
- The present value is the value today of a future payment, taking into account the time value of money and the rate of return that could be earned by investing the money.
- The rate of return, also known as the discount rate, is the expected return on an investment over a certain period of time.
- The time value of money is used in various financial calculations, such as the calculation of the net present value (NPV) of an investment, which is used to determine whether an investment is financially viable.
- In general, the time value of money emphasizes the importance of considering the opportunity cost of money and the potential for money to grow over time when making financial decisions.

## Why can a business case still be refused even if the business case is positive?
- Limited resources or budget constraints
- Prioritization of other projects or initiatives
- Lack of alignment with company goals or strategy
- Insufficient data or analysis
- Risk or uncertainty of potential outcomes
- Legal or regulatory issues
- Lack of support or buy-in from key stakeholders
- Insufficient business case presentation or communication
- Conflict of interest or perceived bias in decision-making process

## Why is not every business case profitable even when it is still persued?

## What external factors can influence a business case?

- Political and social changes (e.g. new government policies, social movements or trends)

## Short term vs long term thinking
- **Short-term thinking**:
    - Focuses on immediate goals and results
    - Prioritizes quick wins and short-term profits
    - May sacrifice long-term sustainability for short-term gains
- **Long-term thinking**:
    - Considers the long-term impact of decisions and actions
    - Prioritizes sustainability and long-term growth
    - May require patience and sacrifice in the short-term for long-term benefits

## What is the difference between: strong business case, useless business case, weak business case and misleading business case?
