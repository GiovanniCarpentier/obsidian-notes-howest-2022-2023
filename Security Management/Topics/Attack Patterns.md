# Attack Patterns
#Attack-Pattern
## Introduction
An attack pattern is a description of the common attributes and approaches  
employed by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in cyber-enabled capabilities.  
Attack patterns define the challenges that an adversary may face and how they go  
about solving it.

They derive from the concept of design patterns applied in a destructive rather than  
constructive context and are generated from in-depth analysis of specific real-world  
exploit examples.

#attack-vector 
Attack vectors are the path or route used by the adversary to gain access to the

### 2 families
- Ingress (intrusion)
